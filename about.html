      <h1>About Machines of Code</h1>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code is a living notebook about problem-solving—built on the foundations of <strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        At its core, this space studies a simple idea: reality can be described through patterns and rules—<em>information, structure, relations, change, limits</em>—and the shapes those ideas create.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This isn't a product company page. Right now, Machines of Code is a place to publish thinking—carefully, honestly, and with depth—so anyone who loves building can sharpen how they see problems.
      </p>

      <h2>What we believe</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information</strong> is the raw material of systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong> is how information becomes usable.</li>
        <li><strong>Relations</strong> are what make meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Change</strong> is what computation tries to model.</li>
        <li><strong>Limits</strong> are what keep us humble—and precise.</li>
        <li><strong>Patterns</strong> are not decoration; they are the map.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What makes this different</h2>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code isn't only about ideas—and it isn't only about code. Each topic is approached in a full arc:
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-primary); margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        <em>Intuition → Model → Reasoning → Example → Build</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So the philosophy stays grounded, and the engineering stays principled.
      </p>

      <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essays</strong> that connect math, CS, and real engineering intuition</li>
        <li><strong>Problem breakdowns</strong> that teach the <em>method</em>, not just the answer</li>
        <li><strong>Build notes</strong> where ideas become small prototypes and clear implementations</li>
        <li><strong>Mental models</strong> for debugging, designing, and reasoning</li>
        <li><strong>Exercises and prompts</strong> to train your problem-solving reflex</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The mission</h2>
      
      <p>
        To become exceptionally good at problem-solving—by seeing patterns clearly, respecting limits honestly, and building systems that actually work.
      </p>

      <h2>Tribute to the craft</h2>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code is a tribute to the craft: the patience of analysis, the discipline of proof, the creativity of design, and the courage to revise your thinking.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This site is for people who want to move from "knowing tools" to understanding foundations.
      </p>

      <h2>Next in problem-solving</h2>
      
      <p>
        This blog will explore questions like:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>How do we turn a vague problem into a crisp model?</li>
        <li>What should we measure—and what should we ignore?</li>
        <li>Where do algorithms succeed, and where do they break?</li>
        <li>How do limits (time, memory, uncertainty) shape good design?</li>
        <li>How do patterns repeat across math, systems, and ML?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Join the journey</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you love deep thinking, clean reasoning, and building strong foundations—welcome. Read, reflect, and return as this notebook grows.
