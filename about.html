      <h1>About Machines of Code</h1>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code is a <strong>problem-solving lab</strong> — a space where anyone can learn to understand problems, find solutions, and build real things.
      </p>

      <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
      
      <p>
        We believe three things:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Problems aren't chaos</strong> — they have structure. Every confusing situation can be broken down into something workable.</li>
        <li><strong>Limits aren't obstacles</strong> — they're design rules. Constraints shape good solutions, not prevent them.</li>
        <li><strong>Patterns repeat</strong> — across math, systems, nature, and life. Once you see them, you can use them everywhere.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Framework</h2>
      
      <p>
        Everything here follows a complete path from confusion to solution:
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-primary); margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.3rem; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">
        UNDERSTAND → SOLVE → BUILD
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Understand</strong> — Use six lenses to see any problem clearly: Information, Structure, Relations, Change, Limits, Patterns.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Solve</strong> — Apply eight strategies to find approaches: Decompose, Analogy, Relax, Backwards, Brute Force, Abstract, Generate & Test, Iterate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Build</strong> — Make it real: Prototype, Test, Refine, Document.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
      
      <p>
        Most education teaches answers. But answers expire — methods don't.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code focuses on the <em>how</em>: How do you take a confusing situation and turn it into a clear problem? How do you find what matters and ignore what doesn't? How do you know when a solution is good enough?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These skills apply everywhere — engineering, business, research, design, and daily life.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> — Learn to think, not just memorize</li>
        <li><strong>Engineers</strong> — Build deeper foundations</li>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — Frame problems in new ways</li>
        <li><strong>Designers</strong> — Understand systems and constraints</li>
        <li><strong>Founders</strong> — Break down complex challenges</li>
        <li><strong>The Curious</strong> — Anyone who likes figuring things out</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        You don't need a math degree. You don't need to code. You just need the willingness to think carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essays</strong> — Deep dives into foundational ideas and philosophy</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Breakdowns</strong> — Step-by-step analysis using the framework</li>
        <li><strong>Build Notes</strong> — Small projects that turn ideas into reality</li>
        <li><strong>Methods</strong> — Frameworks and strategies you can apply anywhere</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Truth</h2>
      
      <p>
        This framework won't automatically solve your problems. No framework can.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What it will do: give you a <em>method</em> for approaching any problem. A way to think when you're stuck. A vocabulary for what's hard. And with practice, an instinct you can trust.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Come here confused. Leave thinking clearer. Practice until it becomes second nature.
      </p>
