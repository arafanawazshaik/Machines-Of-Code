      <h1>About Machines of Code</h1>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code is a <strong>problem-solving lab</strong> — a space where anyone can learn to study problems, see patterns, and build real solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The core idea is simple: <em>every problem, from any field, can be understood through a small set of lenses</em> — information, structure, relations, change, limits, and patterns.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These aren't just computer science concepts. They're the foundations of how anything becomes understandable.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this exists</h2>
      
      <p>
        Most education teaches answers. But answers expire — methods don't.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Machines of Code focuses on the <em>how</em>: How do you take a confusing situation and turn it into a clear problem? How do you find what matters and ignore what doesn't? How do you know when a solution is good enough?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These skills apply everywhere — engineering, business, research, design, and daily life.
      </p>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> who want to think better, not just memorize</li>
        <li><strong>Engineers</strong> who want deeper foundations</li>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> looking for new ways to frame problems</li>
        <li><strong>Designers</strong> who want to understand systems and constraints</li>
        <li><strong>Anyone curious</strong> about how things work</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        You don't need a math degree. You don't need to code. You just need the willingness to think carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>The six lenses</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information</strong> — What do you know? What's missing?</li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong> — How is it organized? What's the shape?</li>
        <li><strong>Relations</strong> — What connects to what?</li>
        <li><strong>Change</strong> — What transforms over time?</li>
        <li><strong>Limits</strong> — What's impossible? What are the constraints?</li>
        <li><strong>Patterns</strong> — What repeats across different domains?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Every essay, problem breakdown, and build note on this site uses these lenses to make complex things understandable.
      </p>

      <h2>How learning works here</h2>
      
      <p>
        Every topic follows the same arc:
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; color: var(--text-primary); margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        <em>Question → Intuition → Model → Example → Build → Practice</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You won't just read ideas — you'll work through problems and build things. That's how understanding actually sticks.
      </p>

      <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essays</strong> — Deep dives into foundational ideas</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Breakdowns</strong> — Step-by-step analysis of real problems</li>
        <li><strong>Build Notes</strong> — Small projects that turn ideas into code</li>
        <li><strong>Methods</strong> — Frameworks you can apply anywhere</li>
        <li><strong>Exercises</strong> — Practice problems to build intuition</li>
      </ul>
